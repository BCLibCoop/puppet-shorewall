Module specific notes:
* This module will take over management of your shorewall configuration.
* You can either use this module to manage everything, or not use it at all.
* There is some middle ground, but you have to figure that out by yourself.
* Despite thos provisos, I do recommend using this to manage shorewall.
* Shorewall is awesome, and puppet-shorewall makes managing awesome, easier.
